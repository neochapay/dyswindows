BUILDING
--------

If you are using a development snapshot, or got this tree from an Arch
archive, then you need to run

  ./autogen.sh

before the tree will be usable.

To configure, compile and install, use:

  ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/dir
  make
  make install

You MUST install before Y will run as it needs to locate its modules in the
installed directory.
